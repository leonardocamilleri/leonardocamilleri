## About Me

I conduct independent quantitative research focused on systematic equity strategies, reinforcement learning, and risk-aware portfolio construction.

My work combines machine learning, statistical modeling, and financial theory to design adaptive, data-driven trading systems.  

This GitHub serves both as:
- A research laboratory for quantitative finance projects
- A portfolio of university projects in AI, machine learning, statistics, optimization, and systems engineering
